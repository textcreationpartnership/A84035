         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereupon the Right Honorable the Recorder then pre≈øent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pa≈ø≈øed ≈øentence of death again≈øt him, That he ≈øhould ≈øuffer Death at the place of Execution, by being hanged by the neck till he died. After which, he was conveyed back to Newgate again, there to remain till the day of Execution.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HAnam</hi> being now condemned to die, and the day of Execution drawing nigh, he re≈øolved to make one de≈øperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for to make an e≈øcape; quickly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to the wonder of all that beheld

            <p>How <hi>Hanam</hi> was pur≈øued after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken again, and how he was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and within ≈øight of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and yet made his e≈øcape again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HAnam</hi> being now at liberty by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pri≈øon, great ≈øearch and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made after him and within a while after was taken in the Country and ≈øo ≈øent up to <hi>London,</hi> and ≈øo conveyed towards <hi>Newgate;</hi> but comming within the fight of <hi>Newgate,</hi> he made a de≈øperate attempt, and got from them, and ≈øo e≈øcaped again.</p>
            <p>How <hi>Hanam</hi> after his ≈øecond e≈øcape went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there committed ≈øeveral rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries more, e≈øpecially, he robbed the late Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> in her Nunnery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HAnam</hi> being now gotten at liberty once more, to prevent his being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170204:8"/>again, got over again beyond ≈øea, and ≈øo ≈øteered his cour≈øe towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where being arrived, he began to exerci≈øe his old accu≈øtomed trade of thieving and robbery again. And having robbed ≈øeveral rich per≈øons, he re≈øolved once more to make an attempt upon the late Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Which he effected in the Nunnery where ≈øhe frequented, and to which ≈øhe had betaken her ≈øelfe, and where ≈øhee had laid up her trea≈øure; which <hi>Hanam</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken notice of, pre≈øently made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ma≈øter thereof, And having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this trade a while, he returned again towards <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>HAnam</hi> having imployed him≈øelfe a while in his arch-trade of thieving at <hi>Rome,</hi> he returned again towards <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

And the thieves (of which <hi>Hanam</hi> was one) being ≈øhut up into a room, got away over the hou≈øes: but returning again, he was taken, having de≈øperately wounded two or three men fir≈øt, and ≈øo kept in ≈øafe cu≈øtody till the morning. Which being come, it being the Lords Day, he was very ≈øtrongly guarded to Newgate; and the Keepers to prevent his further e≈øcape, bound him hands and feet with ≈øtrong chains and fetters of Iron, where multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes daily flocked to ≈øee him, expecting his Execution: which to give the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and Hang-man their due, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Smithfield the 17. day of this pre≈øent moneth; where as he lived wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, he al≈øo died wilfully and de≈øperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <l>and bids the world adieu:</l>
            <l>And for his Thefts and Villanies,</l>
